# Is it a cat or a dog?

We will be using a "Convolution Neural Network" to classify images of dogs and cats

## Convolution Neural Networks

Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) are most commonly applied to analysing visual imagery or "Computer Vision". An image is used as an input, it is processed through the CNN and the output label gives us a probability of which class the image belongs to. In short there are 4 steps to this, they are:
- Convolution
- Max Pooling
- Flattening
- Full Connection

### Step 1: Convolution
